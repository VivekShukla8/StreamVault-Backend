# StreamVault Backend API üíæ

**StreamVault Backend** is the robust and modular API layer powering the StreamVault video streaming and social media platform. It is built on the **MERN stack (Express/Node.js, MongoDB)** and designed for **exceptional scalability and security**.

This API handles the core logic for user authentication, content management, real-time messaging, and channel analytics, providing a foundation for a modern web application.

---

## ‚ú® Features

The backend provides a comprehensive set of features to support both content consumption and creation.

### üì° Real-Time Communication
* **Socket.IO Server:** Integrated server-side logic for real-time, bi-directional messaging, handling connection and disconnection events.
* **Message Requests:** Implements a controlled chat initiation flow via `MessageRequest` model, allowing users to approve or deny message invitations before starting a conversation.
* **Conversation Management:** CRUD operations for managing private chat `Conversation` and `Message` history.

### üé¨ Content & Media Pipeline
* **Cloudinary Integration:** Uses Cloudinary for persistent cloud storage of all media assets, including videos, avatars, and thumbnails.
* **Secure Uploads:** Handles file uploads via **Multer** middleware for temporary storage before transferring to Cloudinary.
* **Video Monetization/Control:** Supports updating a video's `isPublished` status, giving creators control over visibility.
* **Content Discovery:** Implements a comprehensive search functionality covering both **videos and channels**.

### üîê User & Social Features
* **JWT Security:** Uses refresh tokens and access tokens, securely managed via `httpOnly` cookies.
* **User History:** Tracks user `watchHistory` and allows removal of specific videos from history.
* **Content Engagement:** Endpoints for toggling `Like` status across videos, comments, and tweets.
* **Subscriptions:** Logic to handle subscribing/unsubscribing to channels and retrieving subscriber/subscription lists.

## üìÇ Data Models Overview

The application's data structure is built on 10 interconnected Mongoose Schemas.

| Model | File | Purpose | Key Relationships |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User** | `user.models.js` | Core entity for user identity and channel data. | One-to-many (1:N) with Video, Playlist, Subscription |
| **Video** | `video.models.js` | Stores metadata for all uploaded videos. | References `User` (owner), `Like`, and `Comment`. |
| **Playlist** | `playlist.models.js` | Defines custom collections of videos. | References `User` (owner) and an array of `Video`. |
| **Tweet** | `tweet.models.js` | Stores micro-blogging posts. | References `User` (owner) and receives `Like`s. |
| **Comment** | `comment.models.js` | Stores user feedback on videos. | References `User` (owner) and `Video`. |
| **Like** | `likes.models.js` | Polymorphic model to track likes across 3 different entities. | References `User` and optionally `Video`, `Comment`, or `Tweet`. |
| **Subscription** | `subscription.models.js` | Tracks follower-channel relationships. | References `User` (subscriber) and `User` (channel). |
| **Conversation** | `Conversation.model.js` | Manages chat rooms between participants. | Array of `User` references (`participants`). |
| **Message** | `Message.model.js` | Stores individual chat messages. | References `Conversation` and `User` (sender). |
| **MessageRequest** | `MessageRequest.model.js` | Manages pending chat invitations. | References `User` (sender and receiver). |

## üîí Middlewares

Security and file handling are managed by dedicated middleware layers.

| Middleware | File | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`verifyJWT`** | `auth.middleware.js` | **Primary security gate.** Extracts and verifies the Access Token from cookies to authenticate the user for protected routes. |
| **`upload`** | `multer.middleware.js` | Configures **Multer** to process file uploads (video files, images) and stores them temporarily on the local disk (`/public/temp`) before Cloudinary upload. |
